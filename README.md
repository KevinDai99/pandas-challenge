# pandas-challenge

In this challenge I applied data science using the Pandas-Numpy library on the PyCitySchools dataset.

The key areas of focus are
 1) Groupby and various other functions (i.e. count, mean, max, min) to aggregate data
 2) Various joins to merge data
 3) Formating of Data 

Summary of Data 

Overall the analysis illustrates the performance of different schools by district, budget per student, school size, and grade. 

The main conclusions are:

1) The Charter School type has a significantly higher % Overall Passing than the District School type. Further, the top five schools are Charter, whereas the bottom 5 schools are District - out of 15 total Schools - supporting this conclusion. 

2) The data suggest that school size may be correlated with performance, with smaller to medium sized schools out-performing larger schools (2000 - 5000 students). However, due to a low sample size of n =15, more rigourous analyis is warranted.
